# Adjectives

Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns. In French, adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in
**gender** and **number**.

## 📌 Descriptive Adjectives

Descriptive adjectives provide information about the noun they modify. They can describe qualities, characteristics, or
states of being. In French, adjectives usually follow the noun they modify, but there are exceptions.
Some adjectives typically precede the noun they modify, particularly those relating to **beauty**, **age**, **number**,
**goodness**, and **size** (BAGS). These are often short and common adjectives. Other adjectives that can also come
before the noun include those indicating **quantity** and descriptive terms.

### Normal Adjective Placement

Adjectives usually come **after** the noun they modify.

- **un livre intéressant** (an interesting book)
- **une maison rouge** (a red house)

### Adjective Placement Exceptions

This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some common adjectives that typically come **before** the noun:

- **grand** (big, tall)
- **petit** (small)
- **bon** (good)
- **mauvais** (bad)
- **meilleur** (better)
- **jeune** (young)
- **vieux** (old)
- **autre** (other)
- **beau** (beautiful)
- **faux** (false, fake)
- **gros** (large, fat)
- **haut** (high, tall)
- **joli** (pretty)
- **même** (same)
- **nouveau** (new)

## 🔵 Possessive Adjectives

A possessive adjective indicates ownership or possession, and they agree with the noun they modify.
Possessive adjectives always come **before** the noun they accompany and never appear alone.

### Singular Possessive Adjectives

| Gender/Number | Masculine Noun Example      | Feminine Noun Example    |
|:--------------|:----------------------------|:-------------------------|
| 1st Person    | mon frère (my brother)      | ma mère (my mother)      |
| 2nd Person    | ton frère (your brother)    | ta mère (your mother)    |
| 3rd Person    | son frère (his/her brother) | sa mère (his/her mother) |

:::caution
When a feminine noun begins with a vowel or a silent 'h', use **mon**, **ton**, or **son** instead of **ma**, **ta**, or
**sa**.

- **mon ami** (my friend), **ton ami** (your friend), **son ami** (his/her friend)
- **mon amie** (my friend), **ton amie** (your friend), **son amie** (his/her friend)
